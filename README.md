# Smart-Rice-Sorting-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks
 This Jupyter Notebook uses Python libraries like PyTorch and scikit-learn to implement a deep neural network for sorting different varieties of rice based on images. It processes a rice image dataset, splits it into training and test sets, and uses the model to predict the type of rice from a given image.
